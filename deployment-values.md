# Deployment values
{: #deployment-values}

The following deployment values can be used to configure the {{site.data.keyword.spectrum_short}} cluster instance on {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}:

## Mandatory deployment values
{: #mandatory-deployment-values}

The following are the mandatory deployment values used to configure the {{site.data.keyword.spectrum_short}} cluster instance on {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}:

| Value | Description | Is it required? | Default value |
| ----- | ----------- | --------------- | ------------ |
| `app_center_gui_password` | Password required to access the IBM Spectrum LSF Application Center (App Center) GUI, which is enabled by default in both Fix Pack 15 and Fix Pack 14 with HTTPS. This is a mandatory value and omitting it will result in deployment failure. The password must meet the following requirements, at least 8 characters in length, and must include one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character. | Yes | "" |
| `existing_resource_group` | Specify the name of the existing resource group in your IBM Cloud account where VPC resources will be deployed. By default, the resource group is set to 'Default.' In some older accounts, it may be 'default,' so please verify the resource group name before proceeding. If the value is set to \"null\", the automation creates two separate resource groups: `workload-rg` and `service-rg`. For more details, see Managing resource groups. | Yes | Default |
| `ibmcloud_api_key` | Provide the IBM Cloud API key associated with the account to deploy the IBM Spectrum LSF cluster. This key is used to authenticate your deployment and grant the necessary access to create and manage resources in your IBM Cloud environment, see [Managing user API keys](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey). | Yes | None |
| `lsf_version` | Select the desired version of IBM Spectrum LSF to deploy either `fixpack_15` or `fixpack_14`. By default, the solution uses the latest available version, which is Fix Pack 15. If you need to deploy an earlier version such as Fix Pack 14, update the `lsf_version` field to fixpack_14. When changing the LSF version, ensure that all the custom images used for management, compute, and login nodes correspond to the same version. This is essential to maintain compatibility across the cluster and to prevent deployment issues. | Yes | "fixpack_15" |
| `remote_allowed_ips` | Comma-separated list of IP addresses that can access the IBM Spectrum LSF cluster instance through an SSH interface. For security purposes, provide the public IP addresses assigned to the devices that are authorized to establish SSH connections (for example, [\"169.45.117.34\"]). To fetch the IP address of the device, use [https://ipv4.icanhazip.com/](https://ipv4.icanhazip.com/). | Yes | None |
| `ssh_keys` | Provide the list of SSH key names already configured in your IBM Cloud account to establish a connection to the Spectrum LSF nodes. Solution does not create new SSH keys, provide the existing keys. Make sure the SSH key exists in the same resource group and region where the cluster is being provisioned. To pass multiple SSH keys, use the format [\"key-name-1\", \"key-name-2\"]. If you don't have an SSH key in your IBM Cloud account, you can create one by following the provided. For more information, see [SSH Keys](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-ssh-keys). | Yes | None |
| `zones` | Specify the IBM Cloud zone within the chosen region where the IBM Spectrum LSF cluster will be deployed. A single zone input is required, the management nodes, file storage shares, and compute nodes will be provisioned in this zone. For more information, see [Zones](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-a-vpc-in-a-different-region#get-zones-using-the-cli). | Yes | "us-east-1" |
