# IBM Cloud Monitoring
{: #cloud-monitoring-overview}

IBM CloudÂ® Monitoring is a cloud-native, and container-intelligence management system that you can include as part of your IBM Cloud architecture. Use it to gain operational visibility into the performance and health of your applications, services, and platforms. It offers administrators, DevOps teams and developers full-stack telemetry with advanced features to monitor and troubleshoot, define alerts, and design custom dashboards.

| Value | Description | Type | Default value | Validation |
| ----- | ----------- | --------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| `observability_monitoring_enable` | Set this value as "false" to disable the {{site.data.keyword.monitoringlong_notm}} integration. If enabled, infrastructure and LSF application metrics only from management nodes will be captured. | bool | true |
| `observability_monitoring_on_compute_nodes_enable` | Set this value as "false" to disable {{site.data.keyword.monitoringlong_notm}} integration. If enabled, infrastructure metrics from both static and dynamic compute nodes will be captured. | bool | false |
| `observability_monitoring_plan` | This is a type of service plan for {{site.data.keyword.monitoringlong_notm}} instance. You can choose one of the following: lite or graduated-tier. For more information, refer the [IBM Cloud Monitoring Service Plans](/docs/monitoring?topic=monitoring-service_plans). | string | "graduated-tier" | * Condition: Validates if the value matches lite or graduated-tier.  \n * Error Message: "Please enter a valid plan for {{site.data.keyword.monitoringlong_notm}}, for all details visit https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/monitoring?topic=monitoring-service_plans." |

You can use {{site.data.keyword.metrics_router_full_notm}}, a platform service to manage metrics at the account-level by configuring targets and routes that define where data points are routed.

To check if Cloud Monitoring is configured correctly on your VSI, SSH into the instance and run the following commands:

```
systemctl status prometheus
```
{: pre}

```
systemctl status dragent
```
